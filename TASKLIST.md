# Task List: Remove Book Online / Service Booking Artifacts (3 Parts)

- [x] Part 1: Create phased task plan and baseline scan of current repo for booking/service-booking traces.
- [x] Part 2: Remove remaining frontend booking artifacts (privacy copy references, legacy CTA/button styles).
- [x] Part 3: Update docs to reflect final state and verify no active booking/service-booking references remain.

Verification complete: no active Book Online/service-booking functionality or reservation APIs remain in application code.
